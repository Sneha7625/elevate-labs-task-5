#  Bank Account Simulation – Java CLI

## Task Overview

**Task 5:** Simulate basic banking operations like deposit, withdraw, and viewing transaction history using Object-Oriented Programming in Java.

---

## Objective

Build a class-based console application that allows users to:
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check current balance
- View transaction history

---

## Tools Used

- Java 17
- VS Code or IntelliJ
- Terminal

---

## Folder Structure
BankAccountSimulation/
├── src/
│ ├── Account.java
│ └── BankApp.java
└── README.md


---

## What I Did

1. Created an `Account` class to model user data and transactions.
2. Implemented:
   - `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods
   - `showBalance()` and `showTransactions()` methods
3. Used `ArrayList` to store and display transaction history.
4. Built `BankApp.java` with a CLI menu system for user interaction.

## Sample Output
===== Bank Menu =====

Deposit

Withdraw

Show Balance

Show Transactions

Exit
Choose an option: 1
Enter deposit amount: Rs 500
Deposited Rs 500

## Outcome

- Practiced real-world OOP with Java
- Applied concepts like:
  - Classes & encapsulation
  - Method creation and validation
  - List storage and history tracking
  - Menu-driven CLI apps

---

## Deliverable

- Java files: `Account.java`, `BankApp.java`
- CLI-based simulation of bank operations
